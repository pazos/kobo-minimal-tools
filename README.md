**Kobo Tools for building a custom** ***KoboRoot.tgz***

**NOT READY**

I decided to upload it because I can't find an easy way to install ***dropbear*** or ***fmon*** without installing other software that I don't need (KSM, KoboLauncher or the awesome niluje tools).

Before build you can modify *config.txt* to suit your needs.

To build KoboRoot.tgz:

	./kobo.sh build

 To purge generated files:

	./kobo.sh clean
